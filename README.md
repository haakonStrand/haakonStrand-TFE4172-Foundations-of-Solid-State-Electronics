This was written by Haakon Strand, 

Input has been collected from the subject lectures, Rebecca Flugstads notes and the book Fundamentals of Solid State Engineering (4th edition) by Manijeh Razeghi.

The subject collection was written in a week, to prepare for the exam, so read with this in mind.

Everything used in the latex file is included, so feel free to download and update as you see fit for your own exam.
